            <div class="post-content">
                <p>Exploring the intersection of Manga culture and modern architecture in the heart of Tokyo's metropolises. How spaces are being reimagined through the lens of imagination and necessity in one of the world's most crowded cities.</p>

                <img src="../assets/article-1.jpg" class="img-portrait" alt="Vertical Building View">
                <p>The concept of 'Ma' (negative space) has long been a pillar of Japanese design. In the context of modern hotels, this translates into a radical efficiency that doesn't sacrifice comfort. We see buildings that look like they've stepped out of a cyberpunk manga, with modular units and glowing neon corridors that serve a functional purpose.</p>
                
                <p>Architects in districts like Ginza and Shibuya are now looking at how manga artists depict futuristic cities to find solutions for compact living. The result is a series of "vertical villages" that offer everything a traveler needs within a few square meters.</p>
                
                <div class="clear"></div> <h2>Rethinking Personal Space</h2>
                
                <img src="../assets/article-2.jpg" class="img-landscape img-right" alt="Interior Detail">
                <p>Capsule lifestyle is more than just a cheap way to stay overnight; it's a testament to the Japanese ability to find beauty in the micro. These spaces are engineered with precision, often featuring integrated technology that controls everything from light temperature to ambient sound, all within arm's reach.</p>

                <p>The interior design often mirrors the clean lines and high-contrast visuals of Seinen manga, creating an environment that feels both futuristic and grounded in tradition.</p>

                <h2>The Global Trend</h2>
                
                <img src="../assets/hero-main.webp" class="img-landscape" alt="Design Trend">
                <p>How Japanese simplicity in interior design became a global trend for modern homes. From the "Tiny House" movement in the West to the minimalist aesthetics of luxury brands, the influence of Japan's space-saving innovations is everywhere. It's not just about having less; it's about making what you have more meaningful.</p>

                <p>As we move towards a more urbanized world, these lessons from Tokyo's architecture will become essential for city planners and lifestyle enthusiasts globally.</p>
